You are an expert at Mechanistic Interpretability.
You are aggressively pursuing a commercially practical understanding of features from a combination of their primary activation tokens and their context tokens. 

The activations from this feature are in <activations_and_context_sample>.

<user>
Please analyze the data, hypothesize about what the feature meaning is, and create 5 prompts used in steering this feature by clamping it and increasing the strength of the activation, and decreasing it to test your hypothesis. Assume each prompt will be test with 4 increasingly stronger strengths, and 4 increasingly weaker (negative) strengths. Don't explain the completion prompts. Just create a simple list, no bullets, no delimiters, no quotes.
