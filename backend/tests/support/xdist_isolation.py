"""Per-worker isolation for parallel runs, extracted so it can be tested.

`conftest.py` calls this before it imports anything from `src`. It lives in its
own module because the repo's recurring failure is a decision buried where no
test can reach it — the fix that works is to extract the decision into a small
pure function, unit-test it, and have the caller do nothing but call it.

MEASURED (2026-09-25, `tests/unit`, 7,510 tests):

| run                                      | wall    |
|------------------------------------------|---------|
| serial                                   | 16m22s  |
| `-n 8` (xdist default `--dist load`)     | 36m03s  |
| `-n 4 --dist loadfile`, threads pinned   | 4m56s   |

The 8-worker run was **2.2x slower than serial**, so parallelism alone is not the
win; the distribution mode and the thread pinning are. `--dist loadfile` keeps a
file's tests on one worker, so module-level imports are paid once per file
instead of scattered across workers, and pinning BLAS to one thread per worker
stops four torch stacks each trying to use every core.
