"""No assertion may be rescued by a disjunction.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `assert X or True` asserts nothing, and it has now been
found in this repo THREE separate times, in three different arcs:

  * `test_faithfulness_cancellation.py` — removed in an R1 round
  * `test_labeling_sweep_cancel.py`     — removed in an R1 round
  * `test_activation_mask.py`           — removed in the round-3 pass of the
    SAE data-path arc, where it guarded that arc's HEADLINE fix

Each time it was written as a hedge: the assertion was awkward, so a fallback
was bolted on, and the test then passed unconditionally for the rest of its
life. The suite stayed green over a defect in all three cases.

The rule is simple enough to enforce mechanically: if an assertion is awkward
enough to want a hedge, it is the wrong assertion.

Parsed, not grepped — a substring search would match the prose above, which is
precisely the mistake that made this file necessary.
