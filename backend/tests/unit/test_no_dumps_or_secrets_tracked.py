"""No database dump, and no credential, may enter git again.

MIS-E2E-008 / -143. Five `backups/*.sql.gz` dumps and an SSH password were
committed and then mirrored to a public repository. They cannot be withdrawn:
GitHub serves a commit by SHA whether or not anything references it, so a
force-push does not un-publish. Rotation and prevention are the only moves
left, and this is the prevention half.

Checks the git INDEX, not the working tree — the dumps are still on disk by
design (`scripts/backup-db.sh` writes there); what matters is that they are no
longer tracked and cannot be re-added by accident.
