"""
AES-256-GCM envelope encryption for sensitive application settings.

Provides encrypt/decrypt functions and masked display for API keys and secrets.
Uses HKDF key derivation from SETTINGS_ENCRYPTION_KEY or falls back to SECRET_KEY.

Security properties:
- AES-256-GCM: Authenticated encryption (confidentiality + integrity)
- 96-bit random nonce per encryption (never reused)
- HKDF-SHA256 key derivation ensures proper key material
- Post-quantum resistant for at-rest encryption (256-bit symmetric)

    * **Not an envelope** — bad base64, or too short to hold nonce+tag. That is a
      legacy row written as plaintext before service-layer encryption existed.

    * **InvalidTag** — the bytes decode as an envelope and fail authentication.
      That is tampering, or a key that has changed. **Raises.**

    This used to swallow both. The consequence was not abstract: after a key
    change, `decrypt_value` handed back raw base64 ciphertext, which
    `OpenAILabelingService` then sent to api.openai.com in an
    `Authorization: Bearer` header. Encrypted credential material left the
    network boundary because a decryption failure was designed to be silent.
    Swallowing an authentication failure also discards the integrity half of
    AES-GCM, which is the reason the mode was chosen.

    Raises:
        DecryptionError: the value is a well-formed envelope that failed
            authentication. Do not treat the return value as a credential.

        encrypted: The stored value (expected to be base64 ciphertext).
