Please analyze the following requirements and create a detailed todo list that when executed will accomplish them:


@0xcc/img/Model_Tile_GreySwirlClock.jpg >Tab>Models>ModelTile: The small swirl clock to the right of the "Extract Activations" button...when there are no completed "Extracted Activations" jobs, the swirl clock should be greyed, but when there is one or more completed "Extracted Activation" jobs for a modle, the smal swirl clock should be bright green.

@0xcc/img/TrainingJobsFilterCategoryCountsBroken.jpg Tab>Training>TrainingJobs>Job filter buttons: The totals for each category change based on what is on the screen rather than the total completed training jobs that fit each category despite what is visible

0xcc/img/DiscoveredFeaturesActionsStarFavorites.jpg I want to be able to toggle the stars under the "Actions" column to bright green when on, and have the toggle persist. The column should be changed to "Of Interest". 

Please normalize the interface to that when zoomed to 100%, all text is comfortable to read, but is not too large either. Where it makes sense compress the width. Do this to most page elements by taking advantage of blank spaces. Focus especially on the various tiles.

@0xcc/img/Extraction_Layer(s).jpg shows "Layers: 20", but I think it should be "Layer(s): 20" to disambiguate that its the layer number rather than number of layers.
