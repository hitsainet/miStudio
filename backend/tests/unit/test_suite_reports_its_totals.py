"""The suite must state its own totals, whatever flags it is run with.

On 2026-09-07 three consecutive full backend runs produced output containing
no counts at all. `addopts` carried `-q` and the test command recorded in
CLAUDE.md added a second one; at `-qq` pytest drops its own `N passed in Xs`
line. The runs were green, but nothing in their output said so — and the
missing line was first blamed on the `[Emergency GPU Cleanup]` atexit handler,
which writes to stderr and was merely the last thing on screen.

A run that will not report what it counted cannot support "the suite is
green". These tests pin both halves of the fix: the doubled flag is gone, and
the totals line does not depend on the flag being gone.

MUTATION CONTROLS (each must turn this file red):
  * delete the `write_line` in conftest's pytest_terminal_summary
        -> "states its totals even under -qq" fails
  * put `-q` back in pyproject's addopts
        -> "addopts does not carry -q" fails
  * report only `failed` and drop `error` from the counts
        -> "counts collection errors, not just failures" fails
